#### Current Interests

My interests lie in geometry and topology, especially in symplectic geometry and algebraic topology.

#### Recent work

Recently, I'm writing a 50-page review about characteristic classes and Chern-Weil theory.

I am learning about spectral sequence and gauge theory.

For a longer-term plan, I wish to write an exercise collection on algebraic topology in the following half a year.
